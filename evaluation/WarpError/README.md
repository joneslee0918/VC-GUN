# WarpError

## 1 Pre-requisite

Note that this warp error is implemented using Python 3.6 and PyTorch 1.0. Besides, the `cupy` lib is used for this project.

Please build an appropriate environment for the PWC-Net to compute optical flow.

## 2 Download pre-trained model

Please download at this [link](). Then put this model under current path.

## 3 Use the code

Change the `base_path` in file `WarpError_by_txt.py` and run:

```bash
python WarpError_by_txt.py
```
